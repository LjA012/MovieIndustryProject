    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "> The goal of this research is to present insights into the movie industry that will help prepare and inform Microsoft about their new movie endeavour.  This research serves of purpose to Microsoft and all involved stakeholders due to the fact that the Movie Industry has high barriers to entry; capital necessary to shoot a movie, established competitors and multiple streaming/viewing platforms.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "> First we defined what a successful movie would be to Microsoft. We determined a movie's success comes down to its earnings and rating.  With this in mind, we looked at how various factors affected the aforementioned traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "> * IMDB\n",
    "> * The Movie Database\n",
    "> * Rotten Tomatoes\n",
    "\n",
    "* After choosing which data was necessary from the data sources above, we combined that data into a final data source that consisted of 1,103 movies and 33 different features of each movie.\n",
    "* Our list of Actors and Directors are comprised of the 20 most common Actors and Directors, based on number of movies each have been invovled in between the years 2010 and 2018. \n",
    "* We chose to only take data that was between the year 2010 and 2018 - to keep this research up to date and relevant.\n",
    "* The first table below illustrates the financial cost of making a movie.  \n",
    "* The second table shows the earnings and average rating for all 1,103 movies in our data.\n",

    "* Table 1 shows us the average rating that a movie receives, depending who is on the cast. \n",
    "* Table 2 displays the average earnings you could expect, depending on which actor/actress is in the film.\n",
    "* Table 3 gives us the average rating you could expect for a movie, depnding who is directing that movie.\n",
    "* Table 4 visualizes the average earnings that you could assume for a movie, depending on who is directing the film.\n",
    "* Table 5 helps us show which Genre is expected to average the most earnings for a single movie.\n",

    "## Findings\n",
    "> We found that runtime and overall budget did not have as large of an impact on a movie's success as we expected.  For example, on average, we found that to have a noticable impact on a film's rating, one would have to increase the budget by \\\\$200 million dollars. Thus first and foremost, the movie should be made right without worrying about cost and runtime.  That being said, our recommendation is to stay within 1 standard deviation of the mean for both budget and runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> On the other hand, we found that the Genre, Actor/Actress and Director had a bigger influence on a movies success.  The top Genres for a successful movie were Action, Adventure, Musical and SciFi.  Out of the 20 most common Actors and Directors, we chose the ones that resulted in a higher earnings average, then on the ratings average - which is how Microsoft defines success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Genres\n",
    "    * SciFi\n",
    "    * Adventure\n",
    "* Directors\n",
    "    * Christopher Nolan\n",
    "    * Francis Lawrence\n",
    "* Actors\n",
    "    * Jennifer Lawrence\n",
    "    * Robert Downey Jr.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our findings conclude that if Microsoft wants to create a successful movie, we recommend choosing the Genre to be SciFi, Adventure or both; with either Christopher Nolan or Francis Lawrence directing the film and the cast consisting of Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Downey Jr.  As far production and budget are concerned, recommend the runtime to come in between 90 and 125 minutes, and we recommend a production budget no higher than \\\\$110 million dollars.  These recommendations will yield a successful moive with high ratings and high earnings. \n",
